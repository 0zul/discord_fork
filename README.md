![Discord Fork Botlist, The botlist with built in GitHub integration](/.github/header.png)

Add your bot [via the E-Zed editor](https://discordbots.co.uk/edit) or [via GitHub](https://discordbots.co.uk/docs/adding-a-bot/)

NOTE: Please do not complain over how *bad* the site is made, this is mostly made as a
way to be more unique and prove that a list site can possibly be made with Gatsby.

## Requirements
- Node.js 10.x

## Commands
```
gatsby develop
  Set up a development server

gatsby build
  Build Discord_Fork
```

## First Setup
You can use either Microsoft Windows or Linux.
I prefer Microsoft Windows 10, but this will totally work in Ubuntu 18.04 or even WSL.

### Microsoft Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7
1. [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
2. `npm i -g gatsby-cli`

### Ubuntu 18.04, 16.04, WSL Ubuntu, Other
1. `url -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
2. `sudo apt install -y nodejs`
